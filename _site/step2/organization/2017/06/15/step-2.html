    <p>So the obvious next question is - <em>how can you successfully pursue a dream?</em></p>

<p>The problem with this question is that the language makes it unachievable.  Dreams by the very language used to describe them, are deified into unattainability.When you look at a great auteur, you don’t see the work that goes into it. 
The first trick is to couch the dream into a context that is immediately more approachable. This leads us to a reformulation of our question.</p>

<p><em>How can you successfully solve a big problem?</em></p>

<p>Now any self-help book or trainer will tell you - first define the problem, and then break up the big task into smaller ones.
Start small, work your way up. Little by little.
So with any dream, the basic answer is, have a todo-list.</p>

<p>I hate todo lists. I have tried every todo-list app, I have tried setting alarms for todo-lists. I have tried making one on a paper notebook. Admittedly, that worked better, but it was still awful.
Why do todo-lists suck?</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are ugly and unwieldy</li>
  <li>They suffer from the <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</em> mentality.</li>
</ul>

<p>To the first point – it’s important to appreciate the experience of working with a todo-list. Otherwise, it becomes self-defeating. I tried using Gtasks Pro for a while. It had a good system to approaching todo-lists, but the experience of actually using the application was not enjoyable.</p>

<p>But the major problem is <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</em> mentality. Essentially, so long as a todo-list is an application on my phone, or a notebook tucked away somewhere, the list doesn’t become part of the environment.
Instead, it becomes a new habit that I need to practice and form.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem, just suck it up and hold yourself to this new habit for a bit and everything will get better, right?
Sure. So we have a new question.</p>

<p><em>How do you build a good habit?</em>
A good habit is a routinely practiced, desirable behavior given a set of stimulus.
So it needs three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Environmental stimulus</em></li>
  <li><em>Routine Practice</em></li>
  <li><em>Desireable</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I actively loathe using my phone for texting or social media. And I turn off/avoid/ignore the addictive, habit forming notifications as much as possible. Which means…
Todo-list apps don’t <em>actually</em> suck. They’re just bad because I don’t let them be environmentally stimulating. I clear all notifications, and I avoid using my phone. <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind.</em>  And since when have I ever used a notepad? There’s no routine practice there. So that approach too failed. Obviously, now, in hind-sight.</p>

<p>So the best “todo-list” would change my environment such that I’m forced to deal with it. It would work off of old routines, so that dealing with the todo-list would itself be routinely practiced. And to work with the todo-list aught to be an enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>Enter Kanban.</p>

<p>In the Silicon Valley bubble and beyond, you can find various project management tools all designed around getting shit done. Tools like JIRA, Basecamp, Trello, all create methodologies to approach building projects in the most “agile” way possible.
The systems by all of the above are fairly similar and use variations of a board called Kanban. 
A Kanban board has four topics. Backlog, Todo, In Progress and Done. 
The idea is essentially, to take a bunch of Post-it notes, put tasks on them, and move them across the board as they change status over the course of the week. Any other longterm projects go off onto a project planning chart or project backlog, to be used the next week when planning out tasks.</p>

<p>So just to reiterate - set up Post-its each week on the board. As the week progresses, move each Post-it across the board.</p>

<p>Backlog –&gt; Todo –&gt; In Progress –&gt; Done
At the end of the week, assess and mark up pitfalls.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/kanbanAttempt1.JPG" alt="Here's mine." /></p>

<p>and holy shit it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. For the first time in my life, I am getting shit done, and holding myself accountable.</p>

<p>Why does this work?</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Desirable</em>: If the design of the todo-list isn’t working, you have instant access to the “source code” and have the ability to reconstruct the board to your individual liking. This means you’re not working with a user interface that doesn’t fit your style.</li>
  <li><em>Routine Practice</em>: The physical action of writing down tasks, and actively moving them across the finish line, is an inherent gamification that feels far more satisfying to me than simply checking off a tiny box on my phone. Gamification is generally considered the number one way to form habits. It’s a way of creating desireable routine practice. As an added benefit, I really resonate with handwriting and  physical objects, so it’s also a +1 Desirable charateristic.</li>
  <li><em>Environmental Stimulus</em>: The nature of a physical object is that it is something that you just bump into. When dealing with the <em>Out of Sight, Out of Mind</em> mentality, it’s extremely important to get it BACK IN YOUR SIGHTS. I placed my Kanban board on my closet door. If I ever walk into my room, I will see it. I will notice what I have planned for that week, and any tasks I had forgotten about, I remember.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some added benefits that come as a result of the physical nature of the board. There’s no notification vying for my attention, in psuedo-human language “Hey! Don’t forget to blahblahblah!” Notfications are annoying, and when they’re overwhelming, they induce anxiety.
The board is passive, but almost unignoreable. That’s not to say that it can’t induce anxiety - any todo-list can. But anxiety only comes when you have an ill-maintained board. And the nature of the board, Kanban, and Agile methodology includes planning and board maintenance as part of the mechanism of movement. As a result, anxiety is inherently controlled.</p>

<p>When I started this project, I started with just a basic board, no methodology. I quickly ran into some trouble - too many items in the backlog, too little movement of items across the board. The board is not enough. You need to establish micro-quotas. Week by week, how many items you want to accomplish. This adds to the gamification experience. With micro-quotas, there’s a sense of pace. You finish items that you want to complete that week, and you save some time at the end of the week to plan the next board.</p>

<p>It also means you <em>FOCUS</em>. One of my biggest problems is having the attention span of a goldfish. So by preventing overload of todo-items and multi-week planning, the result is actually completing the subtasks that you need to complete.</p>
