This is going to be a candid look at my current state of mind. It's been about a year since I've finished college, and the existential ennui has hit me pretty hard.
In addition to the usual senses of loss of meaning and purpose, I've recently decided to work on my inattentiveness. 
This blog is, I hope, going to maintain as a sort of record of my progress, in the same way people keep track of their progress in a gym. 
You can find other projects and general tomfoolery on my [main website here](http://tzeak.com).
