The Ocean and her Garden


Dear world,
Maybe it’s too early for love letters. 
So lets call this an exploration.
I met someone.
And I am so stoked.
I don’t think I’ve ever been properly excited about someone. 
Love has always been tempered through youth and fear of vulnerability and the tentativeness that comes from emotional immaturity. 
To discover their qualities and values and interests and finding in them the ideals you romanticized?
Stealing daydreams about a romance to idealize
To enjoy each other in an unadulterated mutuality?
To be equal. Affirmed. 
To discover yourself through another person?
To be found.


All of this is clear romanticization, honeymooning - if a relationship is characterized by growth and investment, we are only a sapling. 

But goddamn do I like this girl.
