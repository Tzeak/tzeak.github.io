There is something interesting with the interplay of recent understandings with neural structures (a la the OpenWorm Project) and virtue ethics, namely the idea behind virtuous habits and training.
This obviously doesn't preclude other moral theories from incorporating these newfound learnings, but other moral theory seems to ignore the reality of moral behavior in favor of an idealistic theoretical model. (Virtue Ethics doesn't particularly deviate from this understanding of moral theories, but it seems to get something right inherently that other theories seem to ignore. More on this later).

This blog post should be a first response to the neurocomputational model described in Pyschology of Philosophy, and incorporate SEP entry/sources on Neurocomputation and Virtue Ethics. WIP.
