The essay "The Compatibilist in the Chinese Room" is pretty esoteric and supremely unfulfilling to a significant degree. Part of the fun of philosophy isn't in the obscurity of the language that is used but in the experience of thinking. This is the first in a series trying to explain the essay in "normal" terms.

###Are People Robots?
Ultimately, this essay is about holding robots morally accountable. It kinda feels like a dumb sitaution: robots don't really have feelings, and aren't capable of free will obviously, so the prmise of holding a robot morally accountable is a little stupid.

But the idea of free will has always been under fire from many different angles. It's a nebulously defined concept ascribed to the feeling we have for the freedom we seem to express in our day to day lives. But are we really free to choose anything? As far as we can tell, the world is governed by physical laws. Cause and effect. If we lobotomize someone, they *will* act significantly differently than before and that seems to imply that we operate in a *deterministic* fashion, meaning we too are governed by cause and effect. We too, in some ways, are machines. 

The concept of determinism is what makes this issue interesting for a lot of people - if we're just machines, and machines don't really have any choice, it's difficult to be upset at a machine. After all, it didn't choose to operate that way. It was forced to, or fated to.

### Can you get angry at Robots?

Determinism says that *none* of our actions are truly chosen. They are, in effect, predetermined. But if they're predetermined, are you REALLY at fault for any action? If you shoot someone, are you actually at fault? Can we really get angry at you for shooting someone?

For people that believe in determinism, this splits the camp into two parties: the incompatibilists and the compatibilists.

The incompatibilists, I imagine, say things like "No freedom, no morals!" "Why get angry at machines when you can get angry at the Man, man?" If determinism is true, then holding anything morally responsibile is just a stupid idea. Moral responsibility means you need to have had free choice for a moral action. "I could have chosen to not murder children, but instead I chose to, and there was no compulsion from nature or nurture that caused me to want to murder children." 

The compatibilists, on the other hand, are like "Wait no lets not get rid of all of our morality.It's still pretty useful to get angry and serial child murderers, because our collective shaming of child murderers will prevent them from showing up." In essence, because being mad at people can have positive consequences, even if it's not like FULL freedom, it's still generally a good idea you know to be angry at child murderers.

In both responses, it's a little unsatisfying. The incompatibilists essentially say the normal frameworks of moral responsibility are completely unfeasible, while the compatibilists say that morals are only any good when they're used for social control. If there aren't any positive consequences for getting angry at someone, then there's clearly no point in getting angry at them. 

That life kinda blows. It feels like there are a lot of times we ought to be angry when there are no consequences from our anger. If I learn of human trafficking situation in Australia or India, it seems reasonable to get upset and to condemn such behavior, even if my anger doesn't have any proper consequences on the world or those involved. That's not to say that we should get mad at things that clearly have no cognitive capacity, like Legos, but it seems reasonable to get mad at serial child murderers, even if said serial child murderer is from the other side of the world and dead.

But if the world is predetermined, and people are deterministic machines, is it reasonable to get angry at them?

###How to resent robots

Cue P.F Strawson - this guy wrote an essay in 1963 called "Freedom and Resentment" which created an alternative framework for moral responsibility. He doesn't support the incompatibilists, who say that moral responsibility is dead or grounded in some divine nature of Free Will. But he also doesn't fully support the compatibilists, who try to preserve the worst and least effective kind of morality: the morals that necessarily result in good social behavior.

Instead, he comes up with a neat and clean middle ground - morals and moral responsibilty are based on social reactions. He spends like 15 pages doing this, because using the same consistent academic language is the best way to get old white farts to take your ideas seriously. Let's try it again in normalspeak.

If I stepped on you, there are two different reactions that you may face. The first is the pain of someone stepping on your foot. "Ow!" is presumably your response or "Down with the bourgeoisie" if you identify with the struggle of the common man.
The second reaction is the amount resentment you feel towards me, the person that stepped on your hand. 

Now, if I stepped on you but I did so while saving your dying cat from a tree, you might forgive the transgression and just bear the pain. You still feel the actual pain, but you're not mad. No resentment.

But if I stepped on you because you just had a really steppable face, then you might be super mad. You look at me and throw your hands up and you're like "What the fuck man!?"

Strawson calls this a *reactive response*. Based on the will I gave to you, benevelonce or malicious intent, you adjust your reactive response - in this case, resentment towards me. Even if I never respond to your resentment, you're still justified in feeling resentment. In some sense, the resentment is a social demand, it's like saying "Hey man, don't step on my hand." 
We alter our reactive responses according to the person. For instance, if I stepped on your hand when I was held at gunpoint, you might say "Well he was forced to." But you would probably react to me normally most of the time. But if I were a child, perhaps you'd say something like "He's just a child, he doesn't truly know what is good or bad." So you limit your resentment, and just *"objectively"* react to the child. 

For Strawson, the reactive response is essentially what defines moral responsibility. Sometimes, it is reasonable to treat people with the full range of reactive behavior. "Wow thanks for writing this explanation Rosh, this makes things a lot clearer." or "Wow this explanation was trash I am now more confused and also you'll never become a real philosopher you hack."
Other times, we divorce ourselves from the instutition of feelings so that we can have responses that result in generally good consequences. We do this with children, with people with mental disabilities, and literally any time we try to manipulate people outside of our normal social environments *cough* foreigners *cough* politics *cough* literally anybody that isn't our friend or in our day to day lives *coughcough*.

The result for Strawson is a framework of moral responsibility that says we maintain or morality *in spite of determinism*. Meaning, unless in extreme forms of determinism like being held at gunpoint, we react to people based off of social and emotional ability. Nobody says "well the world is governed by cause and effect, and thats why we're
