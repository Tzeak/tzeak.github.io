who is this for?
I think, in every passing moment, the person we are ceases to exist.
All time measures is a delta between states in the world, including ourselves.
And we use it to create a narrative about ourselves, right? The narrative helps us define our drives.

I'm not sharing this blog in any active sense, and to some degree I hope it never gets discovered (ignore that it's publicly available on github good work team).
The presentation is maybe a rough cut of the person I want to be at the current moment.
So I guess the audience is me? Both me currently, to motivate and direct me in concrete terms.
But also to future me, as fogotten notes to myself, and almost definitely an embarrassing crystallization of my blundering 20s hahaha.

But in any case, this author will pass.
and as I die in this moment, an image of that mindset gets saved, etched onto silicon, like a nuclear shadow.
